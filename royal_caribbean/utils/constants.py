# Process exit code contract for main() - a supervising scheduler can rely on
# these three outcomes meaning exactly this and nothing else:
#   EXIT_SUCCESS         - full success: every account was checked
#   EXIT_TOTAL_FAILURE   - fatal/total failure: an unhandled exception, or a
#                          module-level setup failure. This can happen before
#                          any pricing ran, or partway through a multi-account
#                          run after earlier accounts already succeeded and
#                          had their price-drop alerts sent - the exit code
#                          alone doesn't say how far the run got. Don't
#                          blindly auto-retry on this code (that risks
#                          re-alerting accounts that already succeeded);
#                          surface it to a human and check the log first.
#   EXIT_PARTIAL_FAILURE - the run COMPLETED, but one or more accounts were
#                          SKIPPED after a login or post-login profile-fetch
#                          failure. Data already written for the accounts
#                          that DID succeed (price points committed,
#                          price-drop alerts sent, the watchlist JSON) is
#                          real and must not be redone.
#                          A scheduler that treats this the same as exit 1
#                          and blindly retries the whole run will re-price
#                          already-priced accounts and can send duplicate
#                          price-drop notifications to real users - so this
#                          code is deliberately distinct from the fatal (1)
#                          and success (0) cases.
